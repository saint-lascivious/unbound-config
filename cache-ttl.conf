    # cache-max-ttl: <seconds>
    #     Time  to  live maximum for RRsets and messages in the cache. De-
    #     fault is 86400 seconds (1 day).  When the TTL expires, the cache
    #     item  has  expired.   Can  be set lower to force the resolver to
    #     query for data often, and not trust  (very  large)  TTL  values.
    #     Downstream clients also see the lower TTL.
    cache-max-ttl: 86400

    # cache-min-ttl: <seconds>
    #     Time  to  live minimum for RRsets and messages in the cache. De-
    #     fault is 0.  If the minimum kicks in, the  data  is  cached  for
    #     longer than the domain owner intended, and thus less queries are
    #     made to look up the data.  Zero makes sure the data in the cache
    #     is  as the domain owner intended, higher values, especially more
    #     than an hour or so, can lead to trouble as the data in the cache
    #     does not match up with the actual data any more.
    cache-min-ttl: 300
